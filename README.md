This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of CroVe

## Main idea
**Abstract:** CroVe provides a cross-vehicle collaboration framework using RGB cameras to improve 3D object detection, integrating data from two vehicles to enhance detection accuracy. Two fusion methods are explored: late fusion, which combines detections from individual cameras, and intermediate fusion, which merges feature maps before making final predictions.

## Data generation
To train the single camera model you will need to:
1. Download the OPV2V dataset which can be found at https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/opv2v/.
